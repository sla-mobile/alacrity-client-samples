# Alacrity API Client Samples

This project provides sample code illustrating the use of the Alacrity REST APIs.

Structure is as follows:

* dob/ - Samples showing how to use the Direct Operator Billing (i.e. charging) APIs.
        These APIs allow you to charge mobile subscribers direct to their mobile bills.

* sms/ - SMS-based sending and receiving of SMS messages. Client code coming soon.

* location/ - Location-based APIs. Client code coming soon.

## ``dob/ruby'' Direct Operator Billing Examples

This directory contains a simple script written in Ruby which illustrates the following
DOB API calls:

* Immediate Charge
* Two-phase Payment
* Customer Care - Refunds, Transaction History
* Provisioning Sandbox with test data and downloading test reports

To run the examples, you'll need Ruby 1.9.2 installed. See [here](http://beginrescueend.com/)

once this is done, set up dependencies:

    $ cd dob/ruby/
    $ gem install bundler
    $ bundle install

Logon to the [partner portal](https://www.sla-alacrity.com)
and create an API Login account and a test merchant. Add the details to the configuration file:

    $ cp settings.rb.template settings.rb
    $ vi settings.rb
    ALACRITY_URI='https://sandbox.api.sla-alacrity.com/1.0'
    API_USERNAME='set username'
    API_PASSWORD='set password'
    MERCHANT_ID='set default merchant'

You should be all good to go:

    $ ruby ././run-tests.rb
	Initializer:                                      ok
	immediate charge:                                 ok
	partial refund of previous charge:                ok
	two-phase reserve / capture:                      ok
	two-phase reserve / release:                      ok
	partial refund captured transaction:              ok
	reserve without capture or release:               ok
	retrieve customer transaction details:            ok
	customer transaction history:                     ok
	Finalizer:                                        ok
